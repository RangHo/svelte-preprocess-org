# Svelte Preprocessor for Org-mode Documents

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) preprocessor to import [Org mode](https://orgmode.org)
documents as a component, powered by [ox-svelte](https://github.com/RangHo/ox-svelte).

## Prerequisites

This package deliberately refrains from parsing Org mode documents.
These processes are delegated to an actual instance of Emacs.

Therefore, you need **Emacs 29** or newer installed on your system.
